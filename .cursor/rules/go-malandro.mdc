# Go Malandro

When the user says **"go malandro"** (or equivalent like "go malandro!", "malandro", etc.):

1. Run the project script: `./scripts/go-malandro.sh`
2. Optional: if the user provided a commit message in the same message, pass it as the first argument, e.g. `./scripts/go-malandro.sh "fix: something"`

The script stages all changes, commits (with the given message or default "chore: update"), and pushes to `origin main`. Do not ask for confirmation; run it from the project root.
